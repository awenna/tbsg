# Turn Based Strategy Game is a ..
#### Game project
#### Playground for learning and trying out concepts in a longer-term project

## Description
TBSG is a game project spanning over a couple of years with infrequent work on it.

It's mainly a playground to learn new things and see how they turn out.

### Notable mentions
The project is relatively old and very, very much work in progress. For example many classes may seem pointless, but are important abstractions for future when functionality is added.

The use of Dependency Injection and funtional-oriented style has in some places lead to heavy boilerplate.

The project is in the middle of a major refactoring, it seems.
## Functional goals


## Learning goals
* (Initially) TDD and how to use tests to aid in development work.
* Learning the use of Dependency Injection, Interfaces and mocks, and seeing where those take your codebase
* Finding a comfortable workflow supported by test automation (namely NCrunch)
* Using new testing frameworks and useful testing libraries
* Clean Code & maintainability
* Functional-oriented C#
* Code-generated 2D graphics

## Out of scope
* Organized commits. I'm lazy with git in personal projects.
