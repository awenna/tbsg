UI code is all over the place. 
Refigure responsibilities:
		- Could be code that preps a view: Menu to game etc
	- What draw code actually needs and where to get it




Turns:
	- Data structures for turns
	- Show current turn in UI
	- Main controller

	- Turn:
		[] Action
	- GameState + Turn = GameState
		- Turn processing

	
Camera:
    Rename CameraController to Camera
    Put Camera's variables into CamCont
    Remove old Camera
    
    No point to separate data and function just for the sake of it?

Future features:
-Replays
-Json loading
-Builder app
