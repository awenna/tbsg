UI code is all over the place. 
Refigure responsibilities:
	- Why is gamewindowform passed to panel so that selection state can be Get?
	- What do panels need? Construct them elsewhere?
		- Could be code that preps a view: Menu to game etc
	- What draw code actually needs and where to get it
	
Camera:
    Rename CameraController to Camera
    Put Camera's variables into CamCont
    Remove old Camera
    
    No point to separate data and function just for the sake of it?
